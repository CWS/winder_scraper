# final_project


The project is intended for the batch file to be placed under the scheduler to be run on a prefered schedule.
The google drive functionality requires a secret file which I have not added in this repository so it may not work as intended but may be replaced by your own or bypassed and saved as a file in local machine instead.
since the project was presented some changes have been made to the sites which are scraped so it may not work as intended. I am working on updating the code to get around new popups added.
